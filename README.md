## This is a Java EE work which requested by school.

### Update mark
*   Add Hibernate function into this project.
*   Fix many problems.
*   After a WHOLE I finllay know that hibernate error messenge shows in console is normal color but not error color. This fucking thing             bothered me for a so long time. From now on, every time which I got error messenge I will check the whole console messenge in case          	something like this happen again.

### In the future
*	Alter UserAction.UserCheck() into UserAction.validate();
*	Add table layout into JSP page. Make it looks better.
*	Add Spring support.
